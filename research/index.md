 The rapid progress of single-cell genomics over the past decade has established an important technology foundation for systematically understanding diverse biological processes such as development and tissue homeostasis. These technologies include high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing, cellular lineage tracing with DNA barcoding, and single-cell multi-omics. As these technologies are being integrated to provide richer and more detailed information at the single-cell level, it remains a challenge to effectively extract quantitative biological insights from such large datasets.

We seek to systematically and quantitatively understand cell fate choice by integrating measurements across different modalities at single cells. We have established close collaboration with leading experts in the field to perform single-cell multi-omic lineage tracing, where we simultaneously measure lineage barcodes, transcriptome, DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility in single cells. This provides us with the unique opportunity to systematically understand the relationship/regulation between different modalities, and how they collectively contribute to cell fate choice.

We are also excited to extend our efforts to predict and understand cell fate choice under perturbation and disease, especially using lineage tracing approaches.
