We are devoted to developing advanced lineage tracing tools and applying them to solve important biological questions. Please check out our [publications](/publications) for our latest works.

We have recently developed *MethylTree*, a non-invasive lineage tracing method based on DNA methylation epimutations. This tool opens the door for lineage tracing in humans. Below are our research directions:
* We are now collaborating with hospitals to collect clinical samples and carry out non-invasive single-cell multiomic lineage tracing on human blood and embryonic development. 
* We are also seeking to further improve methylation-based lineage tracing approach, both experimentally and computationally. 
* We are also carrying out experiments to further our understanding of DNA methylation biology. 

In a nutshell, our whole lab is revolved around DNA methylation in the next few years. If you also share our passion that DNA methylation profiles could reveal previous unknown information about a cell's history, please [join our team](/join-us)!
