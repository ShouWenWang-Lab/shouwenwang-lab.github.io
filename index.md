# Welcome to the Wang Lab!

We are affiliated with both School of Life Science and the Physics Department
in Westlake University. We are dedicated to developing novel computational approaches for single-cell genomics, particularly for single-cell lineage tracing. A major focus of the lab will be to integrate single-cell lineage, transcriptome, and epigenome measurements to further understand biological phenomena at different scales, such as cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis. 
 
 We closely collaborate with other experimental groups, integrate cutting-edge experimental designs and data collection for lineage tracing, and draw inspiration from fields such as statistical physics, computer science, and applied mathematics for modeling and data analysis.
